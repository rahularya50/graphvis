# graphvis

_THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS!_

This web app will visualize arbitrary data sets in a tabular graphical (as in vertex-edge graphs, not pie charts!) format, to be used in preparing for competitive programming contests. Ultimately, I aim to allow it to generate test data based off of said input format, to faciliatate rapid debugging when in a timed environment.

Technologies used here include Python, Flask, Javascript, and the Fabric.js HTML5 canvas manipulation library.
